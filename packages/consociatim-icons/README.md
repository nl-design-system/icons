# Consociatim Icons

Consociatim Icons (Coicons) is an icon set that became orphaned due to a brand redesign of a Dutch social domain enterprise application suite. It was decided to donate the set to NL Design System for public use.

## Files and folders

The icon set contains:

- TTF/Coicons-Regular.ttf -- the latest TTF version of te icon set
- coicons.birdfont -- the Birdfont file for managing icons and generating the TTF font file
- demo -- an HTML file for viewing icons and copying snippets (HTML span, CSS content, UTF charachter)
- How-to ontwerpen Coicons.odt -- Dutch styleguide for designing Coicons and instructions for SVG exports and adding it to the Coicons-Regular.ttf font
- coicons_aff2.afdesign -- old, original icon designs made in Affinity Designer 2
